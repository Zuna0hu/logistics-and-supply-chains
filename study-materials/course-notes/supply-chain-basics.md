# Supply Chain Basics

## Supply Chain Definition
A **supply chain** is a global network that delivers products and services from raw materials to end customers through managed flows of information, materials, and cash. It involves **entities** (such as suppliers, producers, and customers) and **processes** (including distribution and logistics).

### Key Entities
1. **Supplier**: Provides raw materials, components, or services (e.g., sugar cane, computer chips).
2. **Producer**: Transforms inputs into finished products or services.
3. **Customer**: Receives the final products for distribution to end consumers.

## Four Basic Flows
1. **Information Flow**: Moves bidirectionally, allowing for communication between supply chain entities and with external actors like governments or markets.
2. **Product Flow**: Physical materials and services flow from suppliers to the end customers.
3. **Cash Flow**: Money flows from customers back up the chain toward raw material suppliers.
4. **Reverse Flow**: Product returns for repairs, recycling, or disposal, also known as **reverse logistics**.

## Supply Chain Management (SCM)
**SCM** encompasses the design, planning, execution, and monitoring of supply chain activities to create value, build competitive infrastructure, and synchronize supply with demand. It applies primarily to corporations and often centers around a manufacturing entity.

## Types of Supply Chain Integration

### Vertical Integration
**Vertical integration** involves bringing all supply chain functions within a single organization, allowing for centralized control. For example, a paper company that owns land, manages its forests, and controls processing and shipping. Key benefits include:
- Enhanced **control** over processes.
- Better **synchronization** across departments.

### Lateral (Horizontal) Integration
**Lateral integration** allows companies to outsource parts of the supply chain to focus on core competencies. Each participant in the chain specializes and contracts with others as needed. Benefits include:
- Achieving **economies of scale**.
- Leveraging specialized **focus and expertise**.
- Improved **communication** and collaboration among companies.

## Examples of Supply Chain Models

### 1. Manufacturing Supply Chain
The manufacturer (nucleus firm) is central, with upstream suppliers on the left (materials, services, and multi-tier suppliers) and downstream distributors and customers on the right. Supply chains vary in tier complexity, extending upstream with raw material sources, like flour, originating from farms and passing through multiple processing stages. Information flows bidirectionally, while products flow downstream, and cash flows upstream

### 2. Service Industry Supply Chain
This model centers on service providers, delivering intangible products. Utilities (e.g., water, electricity) are vital for manufacturing locations. Service supply chains often involve complex management and channel services to households, businesses, or other utilities.

### What is in Common
Both models emphasize a core structure: supplier, producer (or service provider), and customer.

## Supply Chain Structures and Patterns
Supply chains vary in complexity and design, shaped by the nature of the product and logistics strategy:
- **Basic Structure**: Supply chains include tiers of suppliers providing materials and customers receiving finished goods, with variations in tier complexity and network design.
- **Product-Specific Needs**: Simpler products, like sand, require short, simple supply chains, while complex products, like mobile phones, demand extensive, multi-tiered networks.
- **Length and Breadth**:
  - **Length** measures the number of tiers or intermediaries from source to end customer, with direct chains being short and multi-stage chains being long.
  - **Breadth** indicates the number of organizations or parallel routes in each tier.
- **Logistics Strategy Impact**: Supply chains focusing on speed locate facilities near customers, while cost-focused chains centralize operations for efficiency.

### Common Distribution Patterns
- **Direct Shipping** from manufacturer to customer.
- **Shipping to Consolidation Points** for sorting, packaging, and delivery.
- **Shipping via Wholesalers and Retailers**: Various models offer trade-offs between control, cost, and customer service.

## Summary
Supply chains are complex, dynamic networks designed to deliver products and services from suppliers to end customers. Key flows—information, products, cash, and returns—are managed across entities like suppliers, producers, and customers. 

While **vertical integration** centralizes control, **lateral integration** allows for specialized, independent partnerships, which is increasingly common. Supply chains are structured based on product needs and logistics strategies, with considerations like **length** (number of intermediaries) and **breadth** (parallel routes within each tier) shaping overall design. Additionally, distribution methods vary, ranging from direct shipping to multi-tiered networks involving wholesalers, retailers, and other agents.

The optimal supply chain structure depends on the specific product, the organization’s goals, and trade-offs between factors such as cost, control, and customer service.
