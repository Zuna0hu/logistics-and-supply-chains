# Supply Chain Basics

## Supply Chain Definition
A **supply chain** is a global network that delivers products and services from raw materials to end customers through managed flows of information, materials, and cash. It involves **entities** (such as suppliers, producers, and customers) and **processes** (including distribution and logistics).

### Key Entities
1. **Supplier**: Provides raw materials, components, or services (e.g., sugar cane, computer chips).
2. **Producer**: Transforms inputs into finished products or services.
3. **Customer**: Receives the final products for distribution to end consumers.

## Four Basic Flows
1. **Information Flow**: Moves bidirectionally, allowing for communication between supply chain entities and with external actors like governments or markets.
2. **Product Flow**: Physical materials and services flow from suppliers to the end customers.
3. **Cash Flow**: Money flows from customers back up the chain toward raw material suppliers.
4. **Reverse Flow**: Product returns for repairs, recycling, or disposal, also known as **reverse logistics**.

## Supply Chain Management (SCM)
**SCM** encompasses the design, planning, execution, and monitoring of supply chain activities to create value, build competitive infrastructure, and synchronize supply with demand. It applies primarily to corporations and often centers around a manufacturing entity.

## Types of Supply Chain Integration

### Vertical Integration
**Vertical integration** involves bringing all supply chain functions within a single organization, allowing for centralized control. For example, a paper company that owns land, manages its forests, and controls processing and shipping. Key benefits include:
- Enhanced **control** over processes.
- Better **synchronization** across departments.

### Lateral (Horizontal) Integration
**Lateral integration** allows companies to outsource parts of the supply chain to focus on core competencies. Each participant in the chain specializes and contracts with others as needed. Benefits include:
- Achieving **economies of scale**.
- Leveraging specialized **focus and expertise**.
- Improved **communication** and collaboration among companies.

## Summary
In todayâ€™s global supply chain landscape, lateral integration is the predominant model, promoting specialization and partnership among independent companies. While it enhances expertise and scale, it can also pose challenges in coordinating across a network of diverse entities.
